# FirstPhaserGame
First game made with Phaser 3 - JavaScript framework

Game has only one scene which is implemented as a JavaScript Class. The class has the following functions:

  preload - which loads assets into the scene
  create - which initializes the scene, and positions the assets
  update - which is called the last(but is acutally called 60 times per second after previous two functions are called)
  and handles the game's logic
  
  hit - is function that takes care of collision between player and the coin
